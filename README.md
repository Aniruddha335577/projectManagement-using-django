## Installation

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

1. Open your VS Code terminal.
2. Run the following commands:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

1. In your VS Code terminal, run:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    env\Scripts\activate
    ```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure the Database

Edit the `settings.py` file to configure your database settings. By default, Django uses SQLite, which requires no additional configuration.

### Apply Migrations

Apply the database migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a Superuser

Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up the superuser credentials.

### Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available via Swagger UI. To access it, navigate to:

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/)

Alternatively, you can view the ReDoc documentation at:

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/)

## Usage

### Get JWT Token

To authenticate, you need to obtain a JWT token. Use the following request:

- **Method:** POST
- **URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/`
- **Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:**
    ```json
    {
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password"
    }
    ```

### Access Protected Endpoints

Use the obtained JWT token to access protected endpoints:

- **Method:** GET
- **URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/projects/`
- **Headers:**
    - `Authorization: Bearer your_access_token`

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test
```
